# Extension Architecture

This guide covers the architecture and design patterns used for creating Quizlr extensions.

## Overview

Quizlr's extension system is built on Rust's trait system, providing:
- Type safety
- Performance
- Flexibility

## Core Traits

Extensions implement one or more of these traits:
- `StorageBackend`: For custom storage solutions
- `LLMProvider`: For language model integrations
- `QuestionValidator`: For custom validation logic
- `ScoreCalculator`: For scoring algorithms

## Creating Extensions

1. Define your extension struct
2. Implement the required trait(s)
3. Register with the extension manager
4. Configure in the application

## Example

```rust
pub struct MyExtension {
    // Extension fields
}

impl StorageBackend for MyExtension {
    // Implementation
}
```
