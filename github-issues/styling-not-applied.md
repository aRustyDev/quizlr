# Issue: App renders without styling when running `just dev` [RESOLVED]

## Problem
When running `just dev` and visiting localhost:3001, the application displays as unstyled text on a white background instead of showing the properly styled interface.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Run `just dev`
2. Visit http://localhost:3001
3. Observe unstyled content

## Expected Behavior
The application should display with:
- Proper CSS styling from main.scss
- Tailwind CSS classes applied
- Card layouts, buttons, and typography as designed

## Actual Behavior
- Plain text on white background
- No styling applied
- Buttons appear as browser default

## Investigation
Need to investigate:
1. How Trunk processes SCSS files
2. Whether the CSS is being loaded correctly
3. If there are any build errors during development
4. The index.html asset pipeline configuration

## Hypothesis
The issue may be related to:
- SCSS compilation not working during development
- Incorrect asset linking in index.html
- Missing SCSS compiler dependency
- Trunk configuration for style processing
