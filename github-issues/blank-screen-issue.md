# Issue: App renders blank white screen with no content [RESOLVED]

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Run `just dev`
2. Visit http://localhost:3001 in Firefox
3. Observe blank white screen

## Expected Behavior
- Should see "Quizlr" heading
- Should see "Welcome to Quizlr!" card
- Should see "Create Quiz" and "Import Content" buttons
- Should have styled interface with gray background

## Actual Behavior
- Completely blank white screen
- No content visible
- Page source shows CSS is loaded
- Page source shows WASM module is loaded
- No console errors visible

## Environment Details
- OS: macOS
- Browser: Firefox
- Latest commit: 0b31399 (fix(styling): resolve unstyled app issue)
- Development server: trunk serve on port 3001

## Page Source Analysis
- CSS file is loaded: `/main-13a63c4b4fb8b782.css`
- WASM module is loaded: `/quizlr-web-3735397303f067e4.js`
- The `<div id="app"></div>` exists but appears empty
- TailwindCSS CDN is loaded
- WebSocket connection for hot reload is active

## Investigation Needed
1. Check if WASM module is initializing correctly
2. Verify if the App component is mounting to #app div
3. Check browser console for any errors
4. Verify Leptos is rendering the component properly
